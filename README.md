Pseudo Wigner Distribution (PWD) and Smoothed Pseudo Wigner Distribution (SPWD)

DSP File is code from the MeapSoft software which is used in calculating the xcorrelation function of the smoothing window 
for the SPWD implementation.

SIGWD File is the code needed to create the input signal which is used in both the PWD and SPWD.

PWD File is the implementation of the Pseudo Wigner Distribution in Processing.

SPWD File is the implementation of the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner Distribution in Processing.
